'''
9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1. 
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change 
this value and print it again. Add a method called set_number_served() that 
lets you set the number of customers that have been served. Call this method 
with a new number and print the value again. Add a method called 
increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers 
whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you like that could 
represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
